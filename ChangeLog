2006-02-01  Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	* Release 3.04

	Applied a patch from Nicholas Clark to eliminate the dependency
	on LWP, so the module could be incorporated into the Perl core.
	Mad props to Nick for the networking code!

2004-06-20  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>

	* Release 3.03 -- no code changes; I merely added some extra docs
	about -T and security and @INC things.

	Thanks for all your supportive email!  I am surprised by what a
	hit this module has become!
